# Automatic Instrumentation in the IDE

The easiest way to get started with Digma is to use the Digma plugin to automatically instrument your application when you run it in the IDE.

To get started, make sure that that `Obervability` toggle is set to on. You can always use this control to turn auto-instrumentation on and off.
