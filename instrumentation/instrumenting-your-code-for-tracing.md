# Instrumenting your code for tracing

Digma's main input is your code's OpenTelemetry traces. Depending on your application programming language and frameworks/libraries, you may want to select a different strategy for collecting this data or 'instrumenting' your app code.&#x20;

If you're not using OpenTelemetry yet, the [OTEL getting started page](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/getting-started/dev/) is a great place to start. In many cases you won't need to make any modifications to your code at all to get this data.

Digma also provides additional helpers, guides and tools to streamline this process. Check our our [java](java/ "mention") documentation as an example.
