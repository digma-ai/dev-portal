# Analytics vs. Issues

In analyzing the observability data Digma creates two types of code insights:

### Issues

Issues represent possible problems that need to be acknowledged, dismissed, tracked via ticket, etc. They belong on someone's bucket list.

### Analytics

Analytics provide data about your code that is more useful from a design perspective. They provide data on concurrency levels, performance, runtime dependencies, usage and change impact radius.
