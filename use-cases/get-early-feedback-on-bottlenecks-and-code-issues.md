  One thing that Digma tries to do is make observability proactive. This means
  that if there are any issues you shouldn't encounter them when it's already
  late in the dev/release process

# Get early feedback on bottlenecks and code issues

### Learn of code-related issues, from multiple environments

As the code gets executed, either in your local environment, in CI staging, or in production - Digma learns about how it performs, scales, and identifies any process issues or anti-patterns that should be dealt with.&#x20;

As you work on your code, any newly detected issues will appear in the issues side panel as `unread`.&#x20;

Additionally, the code itself will be highlighted to signify whether any critical issues are present:

### Recheck issues after fixing the source problems

Once an issue Digma detected is fixed, you can use the `recheck` option on the issue card. Digma will start re-examining the problem based on new data to determine whether the issue is indeed fixed.  This is not mandatory for detecting whether an issue is fixed but can expedite the detection process.
